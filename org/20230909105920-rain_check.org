+ A pressure from a static "base" look.
+ defense's intention is to appear uncomplicated to lure a response from the offensive protection. The response invoked is one that may be keyed from a defensive perspective, allowing a "read" from the defensive players and trigger a response that is advantageous.
  + this "read" could be the slide or the function of a certain lineman, path of the RB, etc.
  + a "read" pressure example is the [[id:788cbb66-2762-4a9d-adad-64b99b14768f][torch-stunt]]
+ the two box LBs will stem to the B-gaps and simulate a blitz
+ post-snap LBs "read" slide of protection
  + Belichick "pinches" interior defensive linemen to force a more pronounced slide, assisting the LBs "read"
+ when the slide is toward the LB, they pop to coverage opposite the slide.
+ when the slide is away from the LB, they blitz the B-gap.
+ idea is to pressure only to the weakness of the pass protection.
+ expectation of Empty protection, full-slide
