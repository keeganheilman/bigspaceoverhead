#+title: torch-stunt
-----


A "read" stunt performed by two interior defensive linemen (iDL). \\
The two iDL read the Center. When the Center turns toward the iDL, that iDL loops to the opposite A Gap.\\
Meanwhile, the iDL from which the Center turned away impedes the Center from tracking the looping iDL. \\
