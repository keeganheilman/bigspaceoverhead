Most of the blogs have been directing techniques and meditation practices "user friendly format for 21st Century life"<br />
<br />
Ideas of breathing techniques, Ānāpānasati Sutta [<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80n%C4%81p%C4%81nasati_Sutta">wiki</a>] ("purported to be the meditation method of Buddha himself")<br />
Naikan meditation [<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naikan">wiki</a>], have been shared despite difficulty in distilling the Pali texts to their skeletal teachings.<br />
<br />
Ideas of Focus and discipline brought about by the Japanese "do" or, in English trans., "way" (as in "kendo or kyudo").<br />
+ "zen enters through the body"<br />
+ "zen is mind-sitting, not body-sitting"<br />
+ tranquility and wisdom<br />
tranquility may be acheived by "simultaneous calming of the body sensation and emotions generated by a wandering thought process"<br />
wisdom is embodying "serenity and quiescence in turn affects our physical bodily deportment allowing for correct function and relationship to life's various and every changing social involvement and responnsibilities"<br />
<br />
argues a "certain dispassion that requires cultivation" is necessary.<br />
<br />
visibility and transparency of self-identity grant a greater ease to the passing emphemera of phenomena. holding on to the 'thing' "results in creating a dichotomy and chasm that is pure fiction"<br />
<br />
zen ancestors talk about, "all buddhas and sentient beings are simply the One Mind &#x2013; no beginning, no end"<br />
Heart Sutra [<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Sutra">wiki</a>]<br />
<br />
mental constructs are sought to be externally vaidated and reinforced, but it is experience. "What are you doing right now?"<br />
"cognitive attempts at using the mind to grasp at what is ever changing phenomena is a dead end" mind does not fix the mind<br />
<br />
slow down conceptual thought, lessen anxiety, allow peace and tranquility through the techniques shared above<br />
